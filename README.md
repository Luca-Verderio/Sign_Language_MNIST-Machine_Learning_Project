# Image Classification: Sign-Language-MNIST data set
The goal of the project was to implement a **Deep Neural Network**, using **TensorFlow**, to classify different items of clothing.  

This assignment is part of the "DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer" course.

## Deep Neural Network Architecture
The model is comprised of a sequential group of layers, as follows:
- Conv2D
- MaxPooling2D
- Conv2D
- MaxPooling2D
- Flatten
- Dense
- Dense

## Data
The original data set is the following:  
-	[Fashion-MNIST Data Set](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist)

## Tools
Programming language: **Python**  
Python libraries: **TensorFlow**, **NumPy**  
Environment: **Google Colab Notebook**

# Image Classification: Sign-Language-MNIST data set
The goal of the project was to implement a **Deep Neural Network**, using **TensorFlow**, to classify the 26 letters of the English alphabet.  

This assignment is part of the "DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer" course.

## Deep Neural Network Architecture
The model is comprised of a sequential group of layers, as follows:
- Conv2D
- MaxPooling2D
- Conv2D
- MaxPooling2D
- Flatten
- Dropout
- Dense
- Dense

## Data
The original data set is the following:
